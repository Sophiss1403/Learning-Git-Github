# Learning-Git-Github
 1st versioned repo

Please, consider me as a non-fluent English speaker, so I'll probally make some mistake by writing this now. 

This repository it's been made during the "Curso de Git e Github" instructed by teacher Gustavo Guanabara from his Youtube Channel "Curso em VÃ­deo". 

I appreciate his job a content creator and teacher.
